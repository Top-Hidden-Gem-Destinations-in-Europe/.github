## Top 10 Hidden Destinations and Their Historical Importance

### 1. Rovinj, Croatia: A Coastal Paradise

Rovinj, Croatia, is often called the “jewel of the Adriatic.” It is a beautiful coastal town on the western coast of the Istrian Peninsula. With colourful houses, cobblestone streets, and a Mediterranean vibe, this place has more to offer than just stunning views. Beneath the surface lies a hidden historical secret that sets Rovinj apart from other touristy places. One of Rovinj’s biggest secrets is that it used to be an island. Originally, Rovinj was a small, isolated island surrounded by the turquoise Adriatic Sea.

In the 18th century, the narrow channel that separated it from the mainland was filled in, and the island became a peninsula. This was done to accommodate the growing population of the town and to protect against pirate raids that were common in the area. You can still feel this history today. The old town’s layout is a result of being an island, with narrow, winding streets to confuse invaders and houses packed together for mutual defence. Exploring Rovinj’s historic centre is like stepping back in time; every alley and corner whispers stories of resilience and adaptation.

The town surely ranks within the Top 10 Hidden Gem Destinations in Europe. The narrow streets of the Old Town are so appealing to get lost within them. Don’t miss the Church of St. Euphemia’s Basilica and its great view over the surrounding islands.

According to legend, the stone sarcophagus was carried by angels from Constantinople during a storm and landed on Rovinj’s shores as a sign from God. Locals still celebrate this miracle with great devotion.
